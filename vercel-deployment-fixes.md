# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## Issue Resolved ✅

The original build error was caused by `useSearchParams()` not being properly wrapped in Suspense boundaries. This has been **FIXED**.

### Original Error:
```
useSearchParams() should be wrapped in a suspense boundary at page "/accounts"
```

### Files Fixed:
1. **`/components/account-filter.tsx`** - Restructured to wrap `useSearchParams()` in proper Suspense boundary
2. **`/components/date-filter.tsx`** - Restructured to wrap `useSearchParams()` in proper Suspense boundary  
3. **`/components/data-grid.tsx`** - Restructured to wrap `useSearchParams()` in proper Suspense boundary

### How the Fix Works:
The issue was that these components were calling `useSearchParams()` directly at the component level but then wrapping their JSX in `<Suspense>`. This doesn't work because the hook itself needs to be inside a component that's wrapped by Suspense.

**Solution:** Created inner components that use `useSearchParams()` and wrapped them with Suspense from the parent component.

## Remaining Issue ❌

The build now fails due to a missing database environment variable:

```
Error: No database connection string was provided to `neon()`. Perhaps an environment variable has not been set?
```

## Next Steps for Vercel Deployment:

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel project settings
   - Add these environment variables:
     - `DATABASE_URL` - Your Neon database connection string (looks like: `postgresql://username:password@host/database?sslmode=require`)
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your app's URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app` or `http://localhost:3000` for local)

2. **Other potential environment variables to check:**
   - Look for any `.env.local` or `.env.example` files in the project
   - Check what other environment variables might be needed (API keys, auth secrets, etc.)

## Test Build Locally:
To test if the build works with proper environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env.local with your DATABASE_URL
echo "DATABASE_URL=your_connection_string_here" > .env.local
npm run build
```

## Summary:
- ✅ **Suspense/useSearchParams issue is FIXED**
- ❌ **Database connection needs to be configured in Vercel**
- 🚀 **Ready for deployment once environment variables are set**
